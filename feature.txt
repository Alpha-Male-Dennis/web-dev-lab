"This is a feature branch." 
i used the git checkout -b feature-branch command to create the feature.txt
Then, I staged the file using this command git add feature.txt
after staging the file, I committed it to the feature-branch using this command
it commit -m "Added feature.txt for the new feature"
then i pushed it using this git push -u origin feature-branch
i learned how to commit,clone,merge,stage,fork and pull
